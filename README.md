Question 1: After creating the lightning bolt in assignment 2 I already had the idea to incorporate that, so I decided to make Thor's hammer as the catcher.

Question 2: I added to lightning bolts to the sides of the hammer, as if one is summoning them to spawn when they click. Positionning them wasn't to hard,just needed a little practice with the boolean variables.

Question 3: Getting the seed to drop wasn't really a problem for me. The problem I actually had was using the same function for seed as i used for when my mouse is pressed on the hammer.
I had to adjust the lightning bolts position on the canvas so it would randomly drop from anywhere on the x axis, but when i translated it in the function, it messed up my mouseIsPressed funtion.
I solved this by just making to seperate variables, one for the seed, and one for the catcher.

Question 4: I've done enough work with variables now, to where dropping the seed when mousePressed, wasn't really a big obstacle to overcome. The only struggle I faced was having to change many of my values so that the seed would start of the screen and drop faster than before.

Question 5: Had a little bit of trouble figuring out how to create the collision detection, got a little bit of help from a friend on that part. Also changed it so that my seed drops at varying speeds between 6 and 9. Added the hammerIsCharged variable for collision detection.
